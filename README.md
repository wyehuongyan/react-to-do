# React To-Do List

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [ReactJS] - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* [Firebase] - Realtime JSON database for storing and syncing your app's data.

### Basic Functionalities

1. Create a to-do item
2. Edit a to-do item
3. Cross out a completed to-do item
4. Clear the completed tasks

### Installation

After cloning the repository, do a npm install and run gulp.

```sh
$ npm install
```

```sh
$ gulp
```
